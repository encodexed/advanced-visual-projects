A learning repository of small projects and components using advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques.

## Key Learning Points

These techniques and patterns were learnt from an online course.

#### 1 - CSS Transitions

Covers [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) which controls the transition property, key to basic timing and change controls and functionality.

#### 2 - CSS 2D Transforms

Covers [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) which controls the physicality of an element in a few ways: rotate, scale, skew and translate.

#### 3 - CSS 3D Transforms

Covers [perspective](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective) which determines the distance between z-index at 0 and the user, to provide a 3D-positioned element some perspective.

Covers [3D rotation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotateX), using `rotateX(90deg)` for example.

#### 4 - Button Designs
